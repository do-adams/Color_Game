# Color Game

Color Game is a simple color guessing web game made using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I built it as part of a code-along in Colt Steele's Web Development [course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on Udemy. 

It's not terribly interesting but it served as an exercise for interacting with the DOM via JS and putting all of the pieces together in a web project. I went ahead and used newer ES6 language features whenever possible.
